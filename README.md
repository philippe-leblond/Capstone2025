# Capstone2025
Capstone project of my degree in bioresource engineering in W2025 and F2025. The project is to transform a manual irrigation greenhouse of orchids to an automatic system to water the orchids. The irrigation system used is drip irrigation. An ESP32 per table is used to control each table and a Raspberry is able to collect all the data.
